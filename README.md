meas_deblender test data
========================

This repository contains data to validate the performance of the
[meas_deblender](http://github.com/lsst/meas_deblender) product.

At present the repository only holds simulated data generated using
[glasim](https://github.com/GalSim-developers/GalSim) but will eventually also
contain public HSC data that can be used to test the performance of the deblender on difficult fields.
